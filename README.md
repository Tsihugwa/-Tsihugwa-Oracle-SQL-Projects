Welcome to the Car Rental Database project on GitHub!

This code is designed to create a database for a car rental company to track their car models, groups, customers, and bookings.

Some errors have been corrected in this script file, such as changing data types and adding necessary references for foreign keys. Additionally, a table for car groups has been added as it was missing from the original script.

Please note that all table names are preceded by the user-id "bh98kj_" to ensure unique identification.

To use this code, simply run it in your SQL environment to create the necessary tables and views. You can then input and modify data as needed for your car rental business.
