# -Tsihugwa-Oracle-SQL-Projects
Welcome to the Property System Database repository!

This repository contains a SQL command file for creating and populating a database for a property system. The file was initially written by Sue Stirk in 2002 and was amended by Ryan Tsihugwa in September 2022.

The file contains commands for creating and dropping tables for branches, staff, owners, properties for rent, property types, tenants, leases, viewings, and inspections. It also includes commands for creating and dropping foreign key constraints between the tables.

Please note that the file begins with commands for dropping all of the tables, so be careful when running this file as it will delete any existing data in the database.
